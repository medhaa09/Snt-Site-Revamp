summary: The Design and Construction group organizes different activities including designing of popsicle bridge, Spaghetti Bridge and other types of bridges. Along with that different structural analysis are performed practically. Students are encouraged to perform activities on their own ideas and use of different softwares for structural analysis. Basics of designing and softwares are taught through lectures and workshops throughout the year.

## About Us
The Design and Construction Society (DesCon) is a dynamic part of the Science and Technology Council at IIT Kanpur, dedicated to exploring emerging technologies in the fields of design and construction. We delve into exciting areas like 3D modeling, structural simulations, and the creation of immersive VR environments. Our goal is to blend creativity with technology, providing students a platform to work on hands-on projects that are both innovative and futuristic.

We're not just about building bridges — our scope extends far beyond. At DesCon, we explore the latest advancements shaping the construction industry, such as 3D-printed homes and cutting-edge construction techniques. Our focus lies in understanding and applying modern tools and software, encouraging members to push boundaries and redefine what's possible in design and construction.
