summary:  When we think of robots, the first thing that we imagine is a picture of “C3PO” or “Chitti”, both exemplar symbols of the pop culture and more importantly, astonishingly awesome Humanoids! We at Team Humanoid are a group of enthusiastic students who are working towards developing a fully functional Humanoid robot of our own.

## About Us
We are a team of passionate engineers and researchers shaping the future of humanoid robotics. We actively participate in premier international competitions such as FIRA HuroCup, RoboChallenge, and other global platforms that push the boundaries of humanoid robotics.

Our focus spans across advanced locomotion, perception, sensor integration, dynamic balance, and task-specific manipulation—aiming to build intelligent, adaptive humanoids capable of performing in real-world and competitive scenarios. Alongside competitions, we are deeply invested in research and innovation in humanoid robotics, contributing to the academic community through simulations, hardware-software co-design, and AI-driven control systems.
