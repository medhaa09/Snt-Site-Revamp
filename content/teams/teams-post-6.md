## About Us
AUV-IITK is a team of undergraduate students researching in the field of marine robotics. The team started off in 2014, as the brainchild of a group of enthusiastic engineers. We have successfully designed and manufactured 3 robust autonomous underwater vehicles (AUV), namely Varun, Anahita and ATAL. These machines are capable of navigating in unknown environments, performing acoustic localisation and identifying using computer vision.

From a team with just an idea to create an impact on underwater robotics, we have grown into a family of over 40 members, through consistent dedication and hard work. Our team is structured into four core subsystems: Software, Electrical, Mechanical, and Business. These units collaborate closely, ensuring that innovation, precision, and teamwork are at the heart of every mission, making Team AUV-IITK is one of the most advanced student-led Underwater Robotics teams in the country.

We have represented IIT Kanpur in several prestigious national and international competitions:

- NIOT-SAVe (Chennai, India) – 2017, 2019 (Twice Runners'Up)

- RoboSub (San Diego, California) – 2019, 2021 (3rd Position in Website, 4th and 6th position in Skills Video category) 

- SAUVC (Singapore) – 2025 (Qualified among 400 participants)
