## About us
Since the dawn of civilisation, humanity has looked up to the stars with awe, seeking meaning in the vastness above. The Astronomy Club of IIT Kanpur, established in 1975, carries forward that timeless curiosity, serving as a vibrant community for all who are captivated by the cosmos. With no requirement for prior expertise - just a spark of interest - the club welcomes anyone willing to journey beyond the skies.

We conduct a wide range of activities throughout the year, including night sky observation sessions, astrophotography, planetarium shows, hands-on workshops and projects, competitions and engaging lectures. Our club houses its own student-built planetarium as well as a research grade observatory with a 14-inch Celestron EdgeHD telescope. Through our annual flagship events like Astroventure and Hyperion, we celebrate the spirit of exploration, drawing participation from across the country.

We invite all to come join us and gather beneath the stars, surrounded by the club’s telescopes, cameras and interesting student-made technical instruments. Because when you realise you’re made of stardust, it’s only natural to want to know your ancestors in the sky!
