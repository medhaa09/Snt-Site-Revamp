## About us
October 17, 1903 — Ever since the day when man was first able to fulfill his dream to fly in the sky (Credits to Wright brothers who finally took a successful flight of their biplane), there has been an urge among people to how to design better planes, micro-aerial planes, huge UAVs, supersonic planes, rotor planes etc. these are countless and will never end until-and-unless the people do not stop innovating new concept planes — and yes, still the dream is same, to fly in the sky but in a modern way, more fashionable way and more efficient way.

Aeromodelling Club, IIT Kanpur has been innovating new concept planes since 2003 and ever since then there was no turning back, with time the projects have improved, new conceptual airplanes have been made here and it has set its own benchmark at the world level (especially at SAE Aero). Summer project provides the first step to students to convert their innovations, their new ideas and their imaginations into reality, a working model. Similar work has been done this year, many new planes have been made and tested effectively.

In recent few years we have explored some of the latest fields of aeromodelling like composite fabrication and VTOL aircrafts. During the summer projects of 2018 a team of first year students made a composite aircraft for DRDO for the research purpose under the guidance of Professor of Aerospace Department, IIT Kanpur.
