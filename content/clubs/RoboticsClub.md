## About us
Robotics

Just hearing the word should make your chest swell with pride—we are, after all, engineers at IIT Kanpur. This is real engineering. The kind we all dream of doing.

Robotics brings together everything we learn—mechanical, electrical, and software engineering—and fuses it into something that moves, reacts, and comes alive. It’s where theory meets action, and sparks fly—literally.

Sure, some might enjoy sitting behind a laptop screen, tapping away at code—and that’s perfectly fine. But for those who crave adventure, who love to see ideas come to life, who enjoy cutting, welding, building—robotics is for you.

What do we do? Well, it’s no mystery—we build robots.
We go to competitions. We build cool stuff. We have fun.

Whether you’re heading to a competition and need club support, or you’re just exploring a small hobby project—the club is always open to you. The secretaries and coordinators are here to help.

If the idea of shaping the future with your own hands excites you then the Robotics Club is where you belong. Find us in A3, Hall 12.

Everyone is welcome.
