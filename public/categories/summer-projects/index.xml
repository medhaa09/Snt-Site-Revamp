      <description>The acrobatic plane, constructed from lightweight balsa wood, offers the capability for complex maneuvers such as loops, inverted flight, and vertical stands. It features a symmetric airfoil with S8035 profile wings, while the elevator and rudder utilize the NACA0012 profile. Laser cutting creates precise shapes for the components. The wings span 1.5 meters with a chord length of 31 cm, divided into two symmetrical sections, each fabricated separately. Ailerons, each 6 cm wide, are cut from the wings. The propulsion system comprises a 580kV Propdrive brushless DC motor, four servos, a 14.8 V 4S 4200 mAh LiPo battery, a 100 Amp electronic speed controller (ESC), and a six-channel receiver.</description>

      <description>We’ve developed an electronic drum kit with an interface consisting of two drumsticks, each equipped with an Inertial Measurement Unit sensor. The traditional drum pads or any striking surface are omitted. When a drumstick downstroke is detected, drum sounds purely synthesized by the pygame will be played. The drum kit features six types of sounds—hi-hat, snare, hi-toms, crash, lo-toms, ride. Fundamentally, the project comprises of these core layers that require integration- fabrication of drumsticks, drumstick motion sensing, master and peripheral device communication via Bluetooth, audio synthesis program and a frontend for the application to allow for user inputs. As extension goals, we plan on allowing some way for users to give inputs for the kick drum, but for now we plan on focusing on the snare drums, cymbals and the tom-tom drums. As a result of this device, we hope to decrease the noise created by an actual drum-kit, increase the portability and completely eliminate the set up time.</description>

      <description>The Electromyography (EMG) controlled shooting game is an exciting blend of neurophysiology, gaming technology, and human-computer interaction. By utilizing the electrical signals produced by muscle activity, EMG technology allows players to control game actions through their muscle movements. This innovative approach not only offers a unique and immersive gaming experience but also holds great potential for applications in rehabilitation and assistive technologies.**In our game, EMG sensors detect the subtle electrical signals produced during muscle contractions. These signals are then translated into precise and responsive in-game actions, offering players an unparalleled level of control. The game is developed using Unity, a popular and user-friendly game development platform.**The final outcome of our project is a real-time system that allows users to control a Unity-based shooting game using their muscle activity. The EMG sensors capture muscle signals, which are processed and transmitted by a Python script and TCP server. Unity then retrieves this processed data to control game elements, creating an interactive and immersive gaming experience.</description>
