      <description>In this project, we participated in various Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions, focusing primarily on binary exploitation challenges. Through hands-on experience in these contests, we developed skills in identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in binaries. These challenges ranged from buffer overflows to format string attacks, requiring a deep understanding of system internals, memory management, and reverse engineering techniques. By solving numerous challenges, we gained valuable knowledge in binary exploitation, enhancing our proficiency in security analysis and vulnerability research.</description>

      <description>The project covered foundational concepts of version control, providing a solid understanding of Git and its inner workings. It explored Git objects, HEAD, branching, merging, and commands such as git diff, git status, git log, git add, git commit, git branch, git merge, git remote, git fetch, and git push. The internal workings of these commands were studied, and a custom version control system was implemented in Go, incorporating these commands to enhance understanding of development and project structuring.</description>
